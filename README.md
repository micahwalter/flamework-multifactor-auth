flamework-multifactor-auth
===

This is still a work in progress!

These drop-in libraries add support for doing multi-factor authentication in a flamework app.

Presently, this setup uses the [Twilio](http://twilio.com) API to send validation codes to a users mobile phone.

Todo:

1. Add support to enabled multifactor auth on a per user level
2. Add page to update a users phone number
3. Add a "resend validation code" button
